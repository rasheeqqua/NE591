- `performance_test.cpp` - Program for performance comparison of methods

## Problem Description
This program implements and compares four methods for solving linear systems Ax = b where A is symmetric positive definite:
1. LUP (Lower-Upper decomposition with Pivoting) - direct method
2. SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) - iterative method
3. CG (Conjugate Gradient) - iterative method
4. PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) - iterative method with Jacobi preconditioner

### Input
- Input for main solver is read from `input.txt`
- Format:
  - Line 1: Flag (0 for LUP, 1 for SOR, 2 for CG, 3 for PCG) and SOR weight parameter
  - Line 2: Stopping criterion epsilon, maximum iterations
  - Line 3: Matrix order n
  - Next n lines: Elements of the nÃ—n matrix A
  - Last line: n elements of the right-hand-side vector b

### Output
- Main solver output is written to `output.txt`
- Performance test results are written to `performance_results.txt`
- Input matrices for performance test are written to `input_n*.txt` files
- Includes:
  - Header with problem description
  - Verification of matrix properties
  - Echo of input data
  - Solution information (iterations, residuals)
  - For PCG, the preconditioner matrix is also displayed
  - Execution time

### Performance Testing
Performance test implements:
- Testing with matrix sizes n = 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024
- Generation of SPD matrices
- Comparison of iteration counts for iterative methods
- Comparison of execution times across all methods

### Limitations
- Matrix must be symmetric positive definite
- SOR convergence depends on weight parameter
- PCG implementation currently uses only Jacobi preconditioner

### The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method uses a preconditioner matrix M to improve convergence
- The Jacobi preconditioner uses the diagonal of A: M = diag(A)
- PCG typically requires fewer iterations than standard CG for most problems
- The algorithm is designed to be extensible to other preconditioner types in future
